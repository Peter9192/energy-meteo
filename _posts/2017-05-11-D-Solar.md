Dr. Stefan Wilbert is team leader of the Solar Energy Meteorology team at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) Institute of Solar Research. He is currently based in Spain, at the Plataforma Solar de AlmerÃ­a. This is a large solar power plant, where DLR runs a meteorological site for solar technologies. His presentation focused on these techniques: how they work, what meteorological information they require, and how we can measure these data at the site of the solar plant itself.

> Meteorological data is a tool for cost reduction

Dr. Wilbert introduces various forms of solar energy technology. Common ones like the solar PV panels came by, but also more novel techniques such as Concentrated Solar Power (CSP, which makes use of mirrors etc. to focus solar radiation to a central point) and solar heating / cooling. All of these techniques require site-specific information about irradiance, but also temperature, wind, dust... the list goes on. Measurements at the ground can directly be used to make predictions of the current plant yield, but also used as input for a model to calculate future yields. Meteorology is hereby a tool to reduce costs, and select optimal sites for solar plants.

Of all measured parameters, irradiance is naturally the main focus. Satellite data, as well as local ground measurements, of irradiance are used to monitor the plant performance and model its future yield. Radiometers are used to measure solar irradiance. A so-called shadowband radiometer measures the global irradiance, and a rotating band that blocks the radiometer once every minute allows the estimation of the diffuse radiation. Calibration of these local sensors is vital, since poor calibration can introduce a large uncertainty, and thereby a large cost! The spectrum of the incoming radiation is also analysed: sites can vary in terms of spectral signal, and some solar techniques work better under different wavelengths. Knowledge of the solar spectrum is therefore needed to select the optimal solar technique. Solar radiation is not only divided into direct and diffuse, but also in disk radiation (the sun itself) and circumsolar radiation (forward scattered radiation). This circumsolar radiation falls at a slightly different angle than disk radiation, which has implications for the CSP technique which depend on the angle of the light. This radiation can be measured using a special camera, or sets of pyrheliometers.

Forecasting of the variability of irradiance is necessary for the plant control (backup), yield optimization, design of the plant as well as optimization of the grid (peaks of power). Forecasts are made in the very short term: 30 minutes up to hours. This very short-ranged 'nowcasting' is mainly done using sky-photos, taken at the ground from several cameras. Based on these photos, any clouds are geolocated, a projection of their shadow is made, and this shadow map is combined with an irradiance map of the radiometers. So-called 'Shadowcams' are cameras pointing at the ground, which are then used to create maps of the shadow over the plant, once again in combination with the radiometer data.  These maps can be combined with satellite data to forecast plant yield for several hours (up to 6) ahead. 

> Not only irradiance, but also temperature, wind, moisture are important parameters for solar energy

Soiling (the dirtying of the solar panels) can strongly inhibit plant yield. Meteorological data of dust and wind are important to estimate how often the panels need to be cleaned (which is not an easy task!). Reflectometers measure the amount of soiling on panels by comparing them to clean panels. Dust can also be measured directly by scatterometers or air filters. Soiling is just one example of processes that affect the durability of panels: temperature (mechanical stress), humidity (chemical reactions), wind (mechanical load & soiling) and sandstorms (abrasions) are a few others where meteorology provided important insights. Accurate estimations of all these parameters can increase the lifetime of a plant.

Dr. Wilbert concludes his presentation with the message that, while irradiance is the main parameter, several others have to be considered and monitored by meteorological observations to increase efficiency. Meteorological data collection and application serve as a tool to reduce uncertainty and costs, allow for optimal site selection and design, and optimal operation of the plant through forecasting and live data.

From the audience came the question whether cloud dynamics are involved in the nowcasting methods. As of yet they are not, which impeded the accuracy. Cloud dynamics, especially of shallow cumulus, can be very important on the 30 minute to 6 hour timescale of the energy forecasts. Measurements to estimate cloud optical thickness could be used to improve the accuracy of the irradiance forecasts. To the question of the influence of a solar plant on the local energy balance, dr. Wilbert replies there have been no real observations of changing weather caused by the plant, and that it might be similar to a paved urban surface in terms of energy balance. A final question is made about hail forecasts: are they relevant for solar plants? Typically, solar plants are located in lower latitudes where hail occurs only sporadically or not at all. However, in higher altitudes where hail occurs more frequently it can be a severe hazard to solar panels and damage them quite severely.
