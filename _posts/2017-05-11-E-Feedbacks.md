Dr. Robert Vautard is senior scientist at the laboratory of climate and environmental science in France. He has extensive experience in the field of climate modelling and extreme events. Also he participated in the 5th IPCC report. In this symposium he will place renewable energy in the context of climate change and long-term climate variability. He will mainly focus on wind energy aspects, and address three important questions. First of all, how is does climate change impact wind power resources? Secondly, does wind power development have in impact on regional climate. And finally, combining the two: does wind power development have an impact on wind resource?

To answer the first question, Vautard starts with a brief introduction to regional climate modelling. Because long-term climate models run on relatively course resolution, regional climate models are used to refine these simulations on a smaller domain. This is important to assess the influence on climate change on regional circulation and especially for accurate projection of extreme events. It can also be used to assess the impact of regional climate policy. As such, it is suitable to investigate the effects of large wind farms. The EURO-CORDEX regional climate model is used in this study and to assess uncertainties it is run in an ensemble configuration.

One of the tasks in the IPCC reports is to assess the impact of 2$^o$ global warming on energy supply. Vautard describes an experiment in which they computed the power yield from wind turbines based on the EURO-CORDEX wind projections. A simple extrapolation from the 10m wind to hub height is used in conjunction with a reference power curve. This method is quite crude, but in the context of this study it is enough to give reasonable estimates of the changes in wind power. The current fleet of wind turbines is described on [this website ](https://www.thewindpower.net). A complete dataset with turbine locations and characteristics can be downloaded there (not free). To account for future expansion of wind energy, several scenario's have been defined for the future wind turbine fleet. To construct these scenario's, the "CLIMIX" approach was used. Turbines are added over the model domain, with higher density in areas with better wind resources and taking care to avoid unsuitable land use categories, until the projected wind energy production has been reached. This gives a seemingly realistic distribution of wind turbine locations over Europe. 

The downscaled RCP8.5 scenario shows that 10m winds decrease in most of Europe
